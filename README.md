🍽️ Restaurants & Consumer Data Analysis

This project analyzes restaurant characteristics, consumer demographics, cuisine preferences, and rating behavior to uncover meaningful insights for the food and hospitality industry. The database includes information on restaurants, cuisines offered, consumer profiles, customer preferences, and their ratings — enabling a full 360° understanding of both customer behavior and restaurant performance.

📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore patterns in:

Popular cuisines across locations

Consumer behavior based on age, occupation, and lifestyle

Restaurant performance through ratings and customer feedback

Relationships between consumer preferences and restaurant choices

This analysis supports data-driven decisions for restaurant chains, marketers, and food service planners.

🛠️ Dataset Description

The project uses a relational SQL database containing:

Restaurants – Details like location, price category, alcohol service, seating type, and parking.

Restaurant Cuisines – Types of cuisines served by each restaurant.

Consumers – Demographic and lifestyle information such as age, occupation, smoker/drinker status, transportation method, and budget.

Consumer Preferences – Preferred cuisines of each consumer.

Ratings – Customer ratings for food, service, and overall experience.

These tables work together to provide a complete view of customer–restaurant interactions.
